# Non-Planar & Curved Layer Strategies - Research Questions

## Q38: What geometric predicates identify "high-risk" zones where collisions are unavoidable without support structures or reorientation?

## Q39: How do governing field methods (e.g., S³-Slicer) encode collision constraints directly into vector fields rather than as post-hoc checks?

## Q40: What algorithms predict material deformation-induced collisions (e.g., sagging overhangs) during non-planar printing?

## Q41: How should transition zones between collision-free and collision-prone regions be smoothed to avoid abrupt kinematic changes?

## Q42: What strategies exist for proactive collision avoidance by modifying layer topology (e.g., splitting layers) rather than just toolpath adjustments?
