# Mesh Processing & Geometry - Research Questions

## Q35: How do collision detection algorithms leverage signed distance fields versus BVH acceleration structures for nozzle-geometry interactions? Which scales better for complex prints?

## Q36: What mesh simplification techniques preserve collision-critical features (overhangs, internal cavities) while reducing computation time?

## Q37: How do papers handle dynamic mesh updates during slicing when collision avoidance requires modifying previously sliced layers?
