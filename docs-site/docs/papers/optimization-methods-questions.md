# Optimization & Field Methods - Research Questions

## Q43: How do multi-objective optimizers balance collision safety margins against print time and surface quality? What weighting schemes are effective?

## Q44: What field relaxation techniques prevent local minima traps when collision constraints dominate the optimization landscape?

## Q45: How can machine learning surrogate models accelerate collision checks for iterative optimization without sacrificing accuracy?
