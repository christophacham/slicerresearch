# Toolpath Generation & G-Code - Research Questions

## Q46: What G-code extensions (beyond G1/G2) are needed to encode collision-avoidance maneuvers like controlled nozzle tilts or emergency retractions?

## Q47: How should feed rates be dynamically modulated along curved paths based on real-time collision proximity data from digital twins?

## Q48: What strategies encode kinematic feasibility (e.g., jerk limits at rotation points) directly into G-code for 5-axis printers?

## Q49: How do slicers generate collision recovery G-code (e.g., safe retreat paths) triggered by sensor feedback during printing?
