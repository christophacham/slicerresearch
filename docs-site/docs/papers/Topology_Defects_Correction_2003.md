## What problem does it solve?
The source provided is a reference fragment focusing on filling gaps in the boundary of a polyhedron and correcting topological defects in tessellated models. This is foundational for ensuring meshes are manifold and watertight before they undergo the slicing algorithms discussed in later papers.

## Algorithm (from 1-s2.0-S0895717703900793-main.pdf)
- **Input →** Tessellated surfaces with topological defects
- **Output →** Manifold, closed polyhedra

Note: The specific algorithm steps are not detailed in the provided snippet, which serves as a citation list for gap-filling and mesh optimization.

## Analogy
Imagine a knitted sweater with holes and loose threads. Before you can dye it evenly (slice it), you need to patch the holes and weave in the loose ends. This paper provides techniques to "repair" 3D meshes so they're ready for the slicing process.
